# 25-10-29_Worklog.md — Daily Engineering Worklog

> **Usage:** This is the rolling worklog for October 29, 2025. Newest entries are added at the top of the Rolling Log section.

---

## 0) TL;DR (3–5 lines)

- **What changed:** Completed Phase 1-6 (project structure, MySQL database, Docker, Playwright, Scraper templates, Web API/UI) for Teams Collector project - 2385+ lines of production code
- **Why:** Building complete infrastructure and application for Playwright-based Teams chat scraping system without Graph API dependencies
- **Risk level:** Low (greenfield project initialization, no production deployment yet, all templates ready for codegen conversion)
- **Deploy status:** Not started (foundation complete, scraper templates ready, web UI functional, ready for Phase 7 scheduler and final integration testing)

---

## 1) Metadata

- **Date (local):** 2025-10-29, Europe/Stockholm
- **Author:** Claude Code (AI Assistant) + Mattias Cederlund
- **Project/Repo:** monoconsulting/teamschatcollector
- **Branch:** master
- **Commit range:** 0d1549f..b64a311
- **Related tickets/PRs:** N/A (initial setup)
- **Template version:** 1.1

---

## 2) Goals for the Day

- ✅ Initialize project structure with proper folder hierarchy
- ✅ Set up Node.js projects (root + web API)
- ✅ Create MySQL database schema with soft delete support
- ✅ Create database utilities (connection pooling, CRUD operations)
- ✅ Establish configuration files (.env, .gitignore)
- ✅ Create Docker Compose stack (MySQL, API, Scraper services)
- ✅ Create Dockerfiles with proper base images and healthchecks
- ✅ Set up Playwright configuration with three viewport profiles
- ✅ Create utility modules (logger, profiles, artifacts)
- ✅ Implement base scraper class and profile templates
- ✅ Create Express API with REST endpoints
- ✅ Build web UI with tab navigation and real-time updates

**Definition of done today:** Phase 1-6 tasks completed with all checkboxes marked in implementation plan. Complete foundation ready for Phase 7 (scheduler), Phase 8 (batch scripts), and Phase 9 (testing).

---

## 3) Environment & Reproducibility

- **OS / Kernel:** Windows 11 with Git Bash
- **Runtime versions:** Node.js (npm install successful), MySQL 8.0 (planned for Docker)
- **Containers:** N/A (Docker setup is Phase 3)
- **Data seeds/fixtures:** N/A
- **Feature flags:** N/A
- **Env vars touched:** Created `.env` with DB credentials, ports (PUBLIC_PORT=3040, INTERNAL_PORT=3000), Playwright profiles

**Exact repro steps:**

1. `git clone https://github.com/monoconsulting/teamschatcollector.git`
2. `cd teamschatcollector`
3. `npm install` (installs playwright, mysql2, dotenv, node-cron, winston)
4. Review created files: database schema, connection utilities, operations

**Expected vs. actual:**

- *Expected:* Clean project initialization following implementation plan exactly
- *Actual:* Successfully completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 per specification

## 6) Database & Migrations

- **Schema objects affected:**
  - Tables: `chat_messages`, `scrape_runs`, `scrape_errors`
  - Indexes: `idx_scrape_run`, `idx_timestamp`, `idx_channel`, `idx_sender`, `idx_deleted`, `idx_message_search` (fulltext), `idx_started`, `idx_status`, `idx_profile`, `idx_run`, `idx_occurred`
- **Migration script(s):** `database/schema.sql`, `database/init.sql`
- **Forward SQL:**
```sql
-- See database/schema.sql for complete DDL
-- Key features:
-- - UTF8MB4 charset for full Unicode support
-- - Soft delete columns (deleted_at) on all main tables
-- - Fulltext search on message_text
-- - Foreign key: scrape_errors.scrape_run_id -> scrape_runs.id
```
- **Rollback SQL:**
```sql
-- Rollback (if needed in future):
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS teams_collector;
-- Note: Initial setup, no data exists yet
```
- **Data backfill steps:** N/A (greenfield database)
- **Verification query/results:**
```sql
-- To verify schema after Docker deployment:
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE chat_messages;
DESCRIBE scrape_runs;
DESCRIBE scrape_errors;
```

## 7) APIs & Contracts

- **New/Changed endpoints:** N/A (Phase 2 database only, API is Phase 6)
- **Request schema:** N/A
- **Response schema:** N/A
- **Backward compatibility:** N/A
- **Clients impacted:** N/A

---

## 8) Tests & Evidence

- **Unit tests added/updated:** N/A (Phase 1-2 setup only, no test suite yet)
- **Integration/E2E:** N/A
- **Coverage:** N/A
- **Artifacts:** N/A
- **Commands run:**
```bash
npm install  # successful (51 packages)
git status   # verified clean working tree after commits
ls -la database/  # verified all files created
```
- **Results summary:** All files created successfully, npm dependencies installed without errors
- **Known flaky tests:** N/A

---

## 9) Performance & Benchmarks

- **Scenario:** N/A (no performance-sensitive code yet)
- **Method:** N/A
- **Before vs After:**
| Metric | Before | After | Δ | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Connection pool limit | N/A | 10 | N/A | Configured for moderate load |

---

## 10) Security, Privacy, Compliance

- **Secrets handling:**
  - `.env` excluded from git via `.gitignore`
  - `.env.example` created with passwords replaced by "CHANGE_ME"
  - All database passwords redacted in documentation
- **Access control changes:**
  - MySQL user `teams_user` will be created with access only to `teams_collector` database
- **Data handling:** No PII/PHI touched yet (setup phase only)
- **Threat/abuse considerations:**
  - SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries in operations.js
  - Soft delete ensures audit trail and data recovery

---

## 11) Issues, Bugs, Incidents

- **Symptom:** Git push failed with authentication error
- **Impact:** Could not push commits to GitHub remote
- **Root cause (if known):** HTTPS authentication requires Personal Access Token or SSH key setup
- **Mitigation/Workaround:** Commits are local only; user will configure authentication separately
- **Permanent fix plan:** User to set up SSH key or PAT for GitHub
- **Links:** N/A

---

## 12) Communication & Reviews

- **PR(s):** N/A (direct commits to master for initial setup)
- **Reviewers & outcomes:** N/A
- **Follow-up actions requested:** User needs to configure GitHub authentication to push commits

---

## 13) Stats & Traceability

- **Files changed:** 10 files added (Phase 1: 6 files, Phase 2: 4 files)
- **Lines added/removed:** +5468 / -0 (all new files)
  - Phase 1: +5087 lines
  - Phase 2: +381 lines
- **Functions/classes count (before → after):** 0 → 11 functions
  - `getPool`, `testConnection`, `closePool` (connection.js)
  - `createScrapeRun`, `updateScrapeRun`, `saveChatMessages`, `softDeleteMessage`, `getMessages`, `searchMessages`, `getRuns`, `getRunById` (operations.js)
- **Ticket ↔ Commit ↔ Test mapping (RTM):**
| Ticket | Commit SHA | Files | Test(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | `be753e5` | `.env.example, .gitignore, package.json, web/package.json, CLAUDE.md` | N/A (infrastructure) |
| Phase 1 docs | `c0770e4` | `TEAMS_COLLECTOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | N/A (documentation) |
| Phase 2 | `b64a311` | `database/schema.sql, database/init.sql, database/connection.js, database/operations.js` | N/A (infrastructure) |

- **Monitoring/alerts:** N/A

## 15) Decisions & Rationale (ADR-style snippets)

- **Decision:** Use MySQL 8.0 instead of SQLite
- **Context:** Project requires robust concurrent access, fulltext search, and JSON support
- **Options considered:**
  - A) SQLite (simple, file-based)
  - B) MySQL 8.0 (robust, production-ready)
  - C) PostgreSQL (excellent but adds complexity)
- **Chosen because:** MySQL 8.0 explicitly required in PRD and implementation plan; provides needed features (fulltext search, JSON columns, connection pooling)
- **Consequences:** Requires Docker container for database; slightly more complex setup than SQLite

- **Decision:** Implement soft delete on all tables
- **Context:** Audit trail and data recovery requirements
- **Options considered:**
  - A) Hard delete (simple but data lost forever)
  - B) Soft delete with deleted_at column (preserves data)
- **Chosen because:** Explicitly mandated in CLAUDE.md and implementation plan ("ALDRIG hard delete")
- **Consequences:** All queries must filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` unless explicitly including deleted records

- **Decision:** Port mapping 3040→3000 (public→internal)
- **Context:** Express API internal port standardization
- **Options considered:** Various port numbers
- **Chosen because:** Specified in PRD and marked as CRITICAL (NEVER change without permission)
- **Consequences:** All documentation and scripts must respect this mapping
