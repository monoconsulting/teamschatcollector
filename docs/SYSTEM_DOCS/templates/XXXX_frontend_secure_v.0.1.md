## Purpose

This document segment is dedicated to assessing the **security, dependency risks, and data privacy concerns** in the frontend code. Must be filled by inspecting code; no guesses.

---

## 1. Threat Model & Risk Analysis

- What are the likely attack vectors (XSS, CSRF, open redirect, clickjacking etc.)?  
- For each, indicate which parts of code are vulnerable and how mitigation is/should be implemented.  
- Is there a Content Security Policy (CSP)? If yes, show the configuration.  

---

## 2. Dependency & Versioning Risks

- List major dependencies, and for each: version, last known vulnerabilities (if any)  
- Are dependencies regularly audited (e.g. using npm audit, Snyk, Dependabot etc.)?  
- Are there deprecated packages or ones with no maintenance?  

---

## 3. Data Privacy & Handling

- What user data is collected on frontend? Where is it stored / sent?  
- How are cookies handled? Which are essential vs optional?  
- Is GDPR / other regional regulation relevant, and how is compliance ensured (consent, minimal collection, opt-out etc.)?

---

## 4. Logging & Error Reporting

- What logging / error reporting exists in frontend?  
- Any exposure of stack traces or sensitive data in logs?  
- Are error messages sanitized?  

---

## 5. Review Questions — Security & Privacy Focus

Agents **must** answer:

1. Identify any part of code base that is vulnerable to XSS; provide file path & mitigation plan.  
2. Is CSRF a concern for any API endpoints used by frontend? Explain.  
3. Are there any open redirects or unsafe link handling?  
4. List cookies used by frontend: purpose, secure flag, httpOnly flag.  
5. Are any dependencies found with known security vulnerabilities? Which? What versions?  
6. Are there any debug / dev tools left enabled in production?  
7. Is user data handled securely (in transit & at rest)? Explain storage, encryption, etc.
